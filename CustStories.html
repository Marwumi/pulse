              “Cash flow is king, and yet, there are no tools to properly manage it. I think Pulse is really onto something. It took me about an hour to finish entering all of my inflows and outflows and share it with the other partners. I now have a really clear idea of where I need to tighten things up to hit my goals.”

              “Pulse is the only app that has allowed me to easily see how my cash flow changes if I add additional income or expenses and plan accordingly. I would rebuild Pulse as a spreadsheet if you guys stopped offering it.”
